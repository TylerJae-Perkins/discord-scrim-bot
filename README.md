# discord-scrim-bot

This was a little passion project that i got 99% completed before I became busy with personal things, sadly as I do 99% of my coding on another GitHub account I'm missing the pushes.

You're more than welcome to use this code for your own personal usage however, please do NOT sell access to the bot. Anyone found will be requested to take their bot down. Thanks!

If you notice any issues with the code, please create a Issues ticket.
If you want to help improve the code, please create a Pull request!
